# Consolidated billing in India<a name="useconsolidatedbilling-India"></a>

If you sign up for a new account and choose India for your contact address, your user agreement is with Amazon Web Services India Private Limited \(AWS India\), a local AWS seller in India\. AWS India manages your billing, and your invoice total is listed in rupees instead of in dollars\. After you create an account with AWS India, you can't change the country in your contact information\.

If you have an existing account with an India address, your account is either with AWS or AWS India, depending on when you opened the account\. To learn whether your account is with AWS or AWS India, see the procedure [ Determining Which Company Your Account Is With](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/manage-account-payment-aispl.html#determine-seller)\. If you're an existing AWS customer, you can continue to use your AWS account\. You can also choose to have both an AWS account and an AWS India account, although they can't be consolidated into the same organization\. \(Currently, you can't migrate an existing account from AWS to AWS India\.\) If you are in an AWS India organization, the management account can edit the PAN numbers of all member accounts\.

If you create an organization from a management account that is with AWS India, you can invite only other AWS India accounts to join your organization\. You can't invite AWS accounts\.

If you create an organization from a management account that is with AWS, you can invite only other AWS accounts to join your organization\. You can't invite AWS India accounts\.
