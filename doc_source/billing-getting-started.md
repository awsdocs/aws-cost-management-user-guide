## Step 1: Sign up for AWS<a name="billing-gs-review"></a>

If you're new to AWS, create an AWS account\. For more information, see [Getting Started with AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/)\.

## Step 2: Attach the required IAM policy to an IAM identity<a name="step-2"></a>

AWS account owners can delegate access to specific IAM users who need to view or manage the Billing data for an AWS account\. To start activating access to the Billing console and AWS Cost Management console, see [IAM tutorial: Delegate access to the billing console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_billing.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

For detailed information about IAM policies specific for Billing, see [Using identity\-based policies \(IAM policies\) for AWS Billing](billing-permissions-ref.md)\.

To reference a list of Billing policy examples, see [AWS Billing policy examples](billing-example-policies.md)\.

## Step 3: Review your bills and usage<a name="step-3"></a>
