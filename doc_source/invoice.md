# Viewing your monthly charges<a name="invoice"></a>

At the end of a billing cycle or at the time you choose to incur a one\-time fee, AWS charges the credit card you have on file and issues your invoice as a PDF file\. You can download the PDF from the **Account Activity** page in the [Billing and Cost Management console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#/account) using the following steps\. 

**Note**  
IAM users need explicit permission to see some of the pages in the Billing and Cost Management console\. 

**To view your monthly charges**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Billing and Cost Management console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose [Bills](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/bill)\.

1. For **Date**, choose a month\.

   The **Summary** section displays a summary and details of your charges for that month\. It is not an invoice, however, until the month's activity closes and AWS calculates final charges\. 

   If you use the consolidated billing feature in AWS Organizations, the **Bills** page lists totals for all accounts on the **Consolidated Bill Details** tab\. Choose the **Bill Details by Account** tab to see the activity for each account in the organization\.
