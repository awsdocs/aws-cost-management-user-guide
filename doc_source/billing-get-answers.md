# Contacting Customer Support About Your Bill<a name="billing-get-answers"></a>

The quickest way to find answers to questions about your bill might be to start with the [AWS Knowledge Center](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/)\.

In addition, all AWS account owners have access to account and billing support free of charge\. Only personalized technical support requires a support plan\. For more information, visit the AWS Support web [site](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/)\.

This section guides you through contacting AWS Support and opening a support case for your billing inquiry, which is the fastest and most direct method for communicating with AWS Support\. AWS Support does not publish a direct phone number for reaching a support representative\. 

**Note**  
To open an AWS Support case where you specify *Regarding: Account and Billing Support*, you must be signed into AWS as the root account owner\. 

**Contacting AWS Support**

1. Sign in and navigate to the [AWS Support Center](http://aws.amazon.com/support)\. If prompted, type the email address and password for your account\. 

1. Choose **Open a new case**\. 

1. On the **Open a new case** page, select **Account and Billing Support **and fill in the required fields on the form\. 

   After you complete the form, you can choose **Web** for an email response, or **Phone** to request a telephone call from an AWS Support representative\. Instant messaging support is not available for billing inquiries\. 

If you have closed your AWS account, you can still sign in to contact Customer Support and view past bills\.
