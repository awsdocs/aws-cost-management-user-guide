### Examples for alternate contacts<a name="manage-account-payment-alternate-contacts-example"></a>

We would reach out to each contact type in the following scenarios:
+ **Billing** \- When your monthly invoice is available, or your payment method needs to be updated\. If your **Receive PDF Invoice By Email** is turned on in your **Billing preferences**, your alternate billing contact will receive the PDF invoices as well\. Notifications can be from AWS Support, or other AWS service teams\.
+ **Operations** \- When your service is, or will be, temporarily unavailable in one of more Regions\. Any notification related to operations\. Notifications can be from AWS Support, or other AWS service teams
+ **Security** \- When you have notifications from the AWS Security, AWS Trust and Safety, or AWS service teams\. These notifications might include security issues or potential abusive or fraudulent activities on your AWS account\. Notifications can be from AWS Support, or other AWS service teams concerning security related topics associated with your AWS account usage\. Do not include sensitive information in the subject line or full name fields since this might be used in email communications to you\.

## Enabling and disabling regions<a name="manage-account-payment-enable-disable-regions"></a>

AWS originally activates all new Regions by default, which allows your users to create resources in any Region\. Now when AWS adds a Region, the new Region is deactivated by default\. If you want your users to be able to create resources in a new Region, you activate the Region\.

Note the following about activating and deactivating Regions:

**You can use IAM permissions to control access to Regions**  
IAM added three new permissions, which let you control which users can activate, deactivate, and list Regions\. For more information, see [AWS Billing actions policies](billing-permissions-ref.md#user-permissions)\.

**Activating a Region is free**  
There is no charge to activate a Region\. You're only charged for resources that you create in the new Region\.

**Deactivating a Region removes access to resources in the Region**  
If you deactivate a Region that still includes AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, you can't access the resources in that Region\. For example, you can't use the AWS Management Console or any programmatic method to view or change the configuration of any EC2 instances in that Region\.

**Charges continue if you deactivate a Region**  
If you deactivate a Region that still includes AWS resources, charges for those resources \(if any\) continue to accrue at the standard rate\. For example, if you deactivate a Region that contains Amazon EC2 instances, you still have to pay the charges for those instances even though the instances are inaccessible\.

**Deactivate a Region isn't always immediately visible**  
If you deactivate a Region, the change takes time to become visible in all possible endpoints\. Deactivating a Region can take between a few seconds to minutes to take effect\. 

**Existing Regions are active by default**  
The original Regions \(the Regions that existed before we added the ability to activate and deactivate Regions\) are all activated by default and can't be deactivated\.

**Activating a Region takes a few minutes for most accounts**  
Activating a Region generally takes effect in a few minutes, although it can take longer for some accounts\. If activating a Region takes longer than nine hours, sign in to the AWS Support Center and open a case with AWS Support\.

Perform the applicable procedure:
+ [To activate a Region](#enable-region)
+ [To deactivate a Region](#disable-region)<a name="enable-region"></a>

## Turning on tax setting inheritance<a name="manage-account-tax-linked-accounts"></a>

You can use your tax registration information with your member accounts by turning on your **Tax Settings Inheritance**\. After you activate it, your tax registration information is added to your other AWS Organizations accounts, saving you the effort of registering redundant information\. Tax invoices are processed with the consistent tax information, and your usage from member accounts will consolidate to a single tax invoice\.

**Note**  
Tax inheritance settings are only available to accounts after a member account is added\.  
If you turn off tax inheritance, the member accounts revert to the account's original TRN setting\. If there was no TRN originally set for the account, no TRN will be assigned\.

Tax registration information includes:
+ Business legal name
+ Tax address
+ Tax registration number
+ Special exemptions \(does not apply for US sales tax exemptions\)<a name="enable-tax-inheritance"></a>
