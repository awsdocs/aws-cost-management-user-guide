# Monthly Report<a name="monthly-report"></a>

**Important**  
The Monthly Report will be unavailable at a later date\. We strongly recommend that you use the [Cost and Usage Report](billing-reports-costusage.md) instead\.

You can download a monthly report of your estimated AWS charges from the **Bills** page of the Billing and Cost Management console\. If you use the consolidated billing feature in AWS Organizations, this report is available only for a master account and includes activity for all the member accounts\. Member account owners can obtain the monthly report only from the master account owner\. For more information, see [Consolidated Billing for Organizations](consolidated-billing.md)\.

The report contains line items for each unique combination of AWS product, usage type, and operation that the account uses\. The estimated report is updated up to several times per day\. You can get reports for previous months by selecting the statement period, starting with the report for the month when you signed up for monthly reports\. Reports from before you signed up are not available\.
