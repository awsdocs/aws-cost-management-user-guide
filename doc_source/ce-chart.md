# Using the Cost Explorer chart<a name="ce-chart"></a>

You can view your costs as either a cash\-based view \(costs are recorded when cash is received or paid\) with unblended costs or as an accrual\-based view \(costs are recorded when income is earned or costs are incurred\)\. You can view data for up to the last 12 months and forecast how much you are likely to spend for the next 3 months\. You can also specify time ranges for the data and view time data by day or by month\. 

Cost Explorer automatically uses the **Group By** filter for the **Daily unblended costs** graph\. When using the **Group By** filter, the Cost Explorer chart displays data for up to six values in the **Group By** filter\. If your data contains additional values, the chart displays five bars or lines and then aggregates all remaining items in a sixth\. The data table below the chart breaks out the data for individual services that are aggregated in the chart\.
