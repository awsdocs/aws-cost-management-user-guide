You can save your Cost Explorer filters and data multiple ways\. You can save the exact configuration as a bookmark, you can download the CSV file of the data that Cost Explorer used to create your graphs, or you can save the Cost Explorer configuration as a saved report\. Cost Explorer keeps your saved reports and lists them on your report page along with the default Cost Explorer reports\.
