# Consolidated billing in India<a name="useconsolidatedbilling-India"></a>

If you sign up for a new account and choose India for your contact address, your user agreement is with Amazon Internet Services Pvt\. Ltd \(AISPL\), a local AWS seller in India\. AISPL manages your billing, and your invoice total is listed in rupees instead of in dollars\. After you create an account with AISPL, you can't change the country in your contact information\.

If you have an existing account with an India address, your account is either with AWS or AISPL, depending on when you opened the account\. To learn whether your account is with AWS or AISPL, see the procedure [ Determining Which Company Your Account Is With](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/manage-account-payment-aispl.html#determine-seller)\. If you're an existing AWS customer, you can continue to use your AWS account\. You can also choose to have both an AWS account and an AISPL account, although they can't be consolidated into the same organization\. \(Currently, you can't migrate an existing account from AWS to AISPL\.\) If you are in an AISPL organization, the management account can edit the PAN numbers of all member accounts\.

If you create an organization from a management account that is with AISPL, you can invite only other AISPL accounts to join your organization\. You can't invite AWS accounts\.

If you create an organization from a management account that is with AWS, you can invite only other AWS accounts to join your organization\. You can't invite AISPL accounts\.
