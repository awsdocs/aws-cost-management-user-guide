# Managing your payment profiles<a name="manage-paymentprofiles"></a>

****  
**The payment profiles feature is in public preview for AWS Billing and Cost Management and is subject to change\. This feature is available for a select group of customers\. Your use of payment profiles is subject to the Preview Service Participation terms of the [AWS Service Terms](http://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/) \(Section 1\.10\)\.**

Use *payment profiles* to assign more than one payment method to your automatic payments\. If you operate in multiple countries, the payment profiles feature uses valid payment methods automatically so that you can pay all of your AWS invoices for all member accounts across billing entities\.

You can use payment profiles for payments across countries and AWS Regions by specifying your valid, distinct payment method for invoices that meet your preference criteria\. Payment methods vary across countries, due to the technologies available for each country\. By creating custom profiles, you can choose which payment method you prefer for each Region or service that you receive AWS invoices from\. Payment profiles ensure that you have valid payment methods to pay your invoices automatically\.
