# Using the AWS Free Tier<a name="billing-free-tier"></a>

You can try some AWS services free of charge within certain usage limits\. AWS calls this the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)\. The Free Tier is designed to give you hands\-on experience with a range of AWS services at no charge\. For example, you can explore AWS as a platform for your business by setting up a test website with a server, alarms, and database\. You can also try out services for developers, such as AWS CodePipeline, AWS Data Pipeline, and AWS Device Farm\.

When you create an AWS account, you're automatically signed up for the Free Tier for 12 months\. Your Free Tier eligibility expires at the end of the 12\-month period\. When your Free Tier expires, AWS starts charging the regular rates for any AWS services and resources that you're using\.

To avoid charges while on the Free Tier, you must keep your usage below the Free Tier limits\. You are charged for any usage that exceeds the limits\. To help you stay within the limits, you can track your Free Tier usage and set a billing alarm to notify you if you start incurring charges\. For more information, see [Free Tier Limits](free-tier-limits.md), [Tracking Your Free Tier Usage](tracking-free-tier-usage.md)\. For tips about avoiding unexpected charges, see [Avoiding Unexpected Charges](checklistforunwantedcharges.md)\. Contact [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/) if you require additional explanation of unexpected charges on your bill\. 

If you don't use the full benefits provided by the Free Tier in a given month, the benefits don't roll over to the next month\. To maximize your Free Tier benefits, be sure to spend time with AWS each month, trying out the services that you're curious about\.
