# Managing your payment profiles<a name="manage-paymentprofiles"></a>

You can use *payment profiles* to assign payment methods that are different than your default payment method to pay your invoices automatically\. If you receive invoices from more than one AWS service provider \("seller of record"\), use payment profiles to assign a unique payment method for each one\. After you create a payment profile for a service provider, your payment profile pays your AWS bills automatically\. It does so using the currency and payment method that you specify\.

Payment profiles are useful in avoiding situations such as incomplete payments, failed subscription orders, or unprocessed contract renewals despite having a valid default payment method\. By using payment profiles, you can do the following:
+ Use different payment methods for different AWS service providers\.
+ Customize your payment preferences for your AWS Organizations member accounts that use different service providers\.
+ Always have valid payment methods for your automatic bill payments\.
+ Avoid service interruptions and incomplete balances\.

**Note**  
Due to some country and technological limitations, not all payment methods are available for all providers\. If your default payment method isn't valid for different service providers, create payment profiles using payment methods accepted by your service provider\.
