# Using identity\-based policies \(IAM policies\) for Billing and Cost Management<a name="billing-permissions-ref"></a>

This topic provides examples of identity\-based policies that demonstrate how an account administrator can attach permissions policies to IAM identities \(users, groups, and roles\) and thereby grant permissions to perform operations on Billing and Cost Management resources\.

For a full discussion of AWS accounts and IAM users, see [What Is IAM?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_Introduction.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

For information on how you can update customer managed policies, see [Editing customer managed policies \(console\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-edit.html#edit-managed-policy-console) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

## Billing and Cost Management actions policies<a name="user-permissions"></a>

This table summarizes the permissions that allow or deny IAM users access to your billing information and tools\. For examples of policies that use these permissions, see [Billing and Cost Management policy examples](billing-example-policies.md)\.

## Managed policies<a name="managed-policies"></a>

Managed policies are standalone identity\-based policies that you can attach to multiple users, groups, and roles in your AWS account\. You can use AWS managed policies to control access in Billing and Cost Management\.

An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS\. AWS managed policies are designed to provide permissions for many common use cases\. AWS managed policies make it easier for you to assign appropriate permissions to users, groups, and roles than if you had to write the policies yourself\.

You can't change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies\. AWS occasionally updates the permissions defined in an AWS managed policy\. When this occurs, the update affects all principal entities \(users, groups, and roles\) that the policy is attached to\.

Billing and Cost Management provides several AWS managed policies for common use cases\.

+ [Allows AWS Budgets broad permission to control AWS resources](#budget-managedIAM-SSM)

### Allows full access to AWS Budgets including budgets actions<a name="budget-managedIAM-full"></a>

Managed policy name: `AWSBudgetsActionsWithAWSResourceControlAccess`

This managed policy is focused on the user, ensuring that you have the proper permissions to grant permission to AWS Budgets to run the defined actions\. This policy provides full access to AWS Budgets, including budgets actions, to retrieve the status of your policies and run AWS resources using the AWS Management Console\.

### Allows AWS Budgets broad permission to control AWS resources<a name="budget-managedIAM-SSM"></a>

Managed policy name: `AWSBudgetsActionsRolePolicyForResourceAdministrationWithSSM`

This managed policy is focused on specific actions that AWS Budgets takes on your behalf when completing a specific action\. This policy gives AWS Budgets broad permission to control AWS resources\. For example, starts and stops Amazon EC2 or Amazon RDS instances by running AWS Systems Manager \(SSM\) scripts\.
