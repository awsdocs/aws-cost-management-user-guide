# Using identity\-based policies \(IAM policies\) for AWS Billing<a name="billing-permissions-ref"></a>


|  | 
| --- |
| ***The following AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) actions will reach the end of standard support on July 2023: `aws-portal` namespace, `purchase-orders:ViewPurchaseOrders`, and `purchase-orders:ModifyPurchaseOrders`\. See the [Using fine\-grained AWS Billing actions ](migrate-granularaccess-whatis.md#migrate-user-permissions) to replace these actions with fine\-grained actions so you have access to AWS Billing, AWS Cost Management, and AWS accounts consoles\.*** ***If you created your AWS account, or are a part of an AWS Organizations created before March 6, 2023, 11:00 \(PDT\), the fine\-grained actions will be effective starting July 2023\. We recommend you to add the fine\-grained actions, but not remove your existing permissions with `aws-portal` or `purchase-orders` prefixes\.*** ***If you created your AWS account, or are a part of an AWS Organizations created on or after March 6, 2023, 11:00 \(PDT\), the fine\-grained actions are effective immediately\.***  | 

This topic provides examples of several identity\-based policies\. These policies that demonstrate how an account administrator attaches permissions policies to IAM identities \(users, groups, and roles\) to grant permissions for performing operations on Billing resources\.

## AWS Billing actions policies<a name="user-permissions"></a>

This table summarizes the permissions that allow or deny IAM users access to your billing information and tools\. For examples of policies that use these permissions, see [AWS Billing policy examples](billing-example-policies.md)\. 

For a list of actions policies for the AWS Cost Management console, see [AWS Cost Management actions policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/billing-permissions-ref.html#user-permissions) in the *AWS Cost Management user guide*\.

## Managed policies<a name="managed-policies"></a>

Managed policies are standalone identity\-based policies that you can attach to multiple users, groups, and roles in your AWS account\. You can use AWS managed policies to control access in Billing\.

An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that's created and administered by AWS\. AWS managed policies are designed to provide permissions for many common use cases\. AWS managed policies make it easier for you to assign appropriate permissions to users, groups, and roles than if you had to write the policies yourself\.

You can't change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies\. AWS occasionally updates the permissions that are defined in an AWS managed policy\. When this occurs, the update affects all principal entities \(users, groups, and roles\) that the policy is attached to\.

Billing provides several AWS managed policies for common use cases\.

### Allow full access to the Billing console and to manage purchase orders<a name="security-iam-awsmanpol-AWSPurchaseOrdersServiceRolePolicy"></a>

Managed policy name: `AWSPurchaseOrdersServiceRolePolicy`

This managed policy grants full access to the Billing console and to the Purchase orders console\. The policy allows the user to view, create, update, and delete the account's purchase orders\.
