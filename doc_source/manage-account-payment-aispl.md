# Managing an account in India<a name="manage-account-payment-aispl"></a>

If you sign up for a new account and choose India for your contact address, your user agreement is with Amazon Internet Services Pvt\. Ltd \(AISPL\), a local AWS seller in India\. AISPL manages your billing, and your invoice total is listed in rupees instead of dollars\. After you create an account with AISPL, you can't change the country in your contact information\. 

If you have an existing account with an India address, your account is either with AWS or AISPL, depending on when you opened the account\. To learn whether your account is with AWS or AISPL, see the procedure [Determining Which Company Your Account is With](#determine-seller)\. If you are an existing AWS customer, you can continue to use your AWS account\. You also can choose to have both an AWS account and an AISPL account, though they can't be consolidated into the same payment family\. For information about managing an AWS account, see [Managing an AWS account](manage-account-payment.md)\. 

If your account is with AISPL, follow the procedures in this chapter to manage your account\. This chapter explains how to sign up for an AISPL account, edit information about your AISPL account, and add or edit your Permanent Account Number \(PAN\)\. 

As part of the credit card verification during signup, AISPL charges your credit card 2 INR\. AISPL refunds the 2 INR after verification is done\. You might be redirected to your bank as part of the verification process\.
