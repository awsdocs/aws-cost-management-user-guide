# Using the bulk API<a name="using-ppslong"></a>

The AWS Price List Bulk API is actually a URL that provides up\-to\-date pricing information on the current AWS products and services\. To access pricing information using the bulk API, download the offer file:
+ **Offer file** – A JSON or CSV file that lists the products and prices for either a single AWS service in all Regions or a single AWS service in a specific Region\. For more information, see [Downloading an offer file](#download-offers)\.

To find a list of all available offer files, download the offer index file:
+ **Offer index file** – A JSON file that lists the supported AWS services, with a URL for each offer file where you can download pricing details\. The file also includes metadata about the offer index file itself, URLs for service offer files, and URLs for regional offer index files\. For more information, see [Downloading an offer index file](#download-the-offer-index)\.

Offer files don't include information about expiring free tier offers or Amazon EC2 Spot Instances\. 

**Note**  
The AWS Price List Bulk API provides pricing details for your information only\. If there is a discrepancy between the offer file and a service pricing page, AWS charges the prices that are listed on the service pricing page\. For more information about AWS service pricing, see [Cloud Services Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/services/)\.
