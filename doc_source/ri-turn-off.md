# Turning off reserved instances and Savings Plans discount sharing<a name="ri-turn-off"></a>

The management account of an organization can turn off Reserved Instance \(RI\) discount and Savings Plans discount sharing for any accounts in that organization, including the management account\. This means that RIs and Savings Plans discounts aren't shared between any accounts that have sharing turned off\. To share an RI or Savings Plans discount with an account, both accounts must have sharing turned on\. This preference isn't permanent, and you can change it at any time\. Each estimated bill is computed using the last set of preferences\. The final bill for the month is calculated based on the preferences set at 23:59:59 UTC time on the last day of the month\.

**Important**  
Turning off RI and Savings Plans discount sharing can result in a higher monthly bill\.
