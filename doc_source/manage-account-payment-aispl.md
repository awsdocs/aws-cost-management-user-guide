# Managing an account in India<a name="manage-account-payment-aispl"></a>

If you sign up for a new account and choose India for your contact address, your user agreement is with Amazon Web Services India Private Limited \(AWS India\), a local AWS seller in India\. AWS India manages your billing, and your invoice total is listed in rupees instead of dollars\. After you create an account with AWS India, you can't change the country in your contact information\. 

If you have an existing account with an India address, your account is either with AWS or AWS India, depending on when you opened the account\. To learn whether your account is with AWS or AWS India, see the procedure [Determining Which Company Your Account is With](#determine-seller)\. If you're an existing AWS customer, you can continue to use your AWS account\. You also can choose to have both an AWS account and an AWS India account, though they can't be consolidated into the same payment family\. For information about managing an AWS account, see [Managing an AWS account](manage-account-payment.md)\. 

If your account is with AWS India, follow the procedures in this chapter to manage your account\. This chapter explains how to sign up for an AWS India account, edit information about your AWS India account, and add or edit your Permanent Account Number \(PAN\)\. 

As part of the credit card verification during signup, AWS India charges your credit card 2 INR\. AWS India refunds the 2 INR after verification is done\. You might be redirected to your bank as part of the verification process\.
