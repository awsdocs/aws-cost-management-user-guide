# Reading your dashboard graphs<a name="view-billing-dashboard"></a>

Even if you're using the free tier, it's a good idea to periodically check the Billing and Cost Management console dashboard\. From the dashboard, you can check various graphs that show different breakdowns of your AWS usage\.

On the dashboard you can view the following graphs:
+ **Spend Summary**
+ **Month\-to\-Date Spend by Service**
+ **Month\-to\-Date Top Services by Spend**

**Spend Summary**  
The **Spend Summary** graph shows you how much you spent last month, the estimated costs of your AWS usage for the month\-to\-date, and a forecast for how much you are likely to spend this month\. The forecast is an estimate based on your past AWS costs, so your actual monthly costs might not match the forecast\.

**Month\-to\-Date Spend by Service**  
The **Month\-to\-Date Spend by Service** graph shows the top services that you use most and the proportion of your costs that that service contributed to\. The **Month\-to\-Date Spend by Service** graph doesn't include forecasting\.

**Month\-to\-Date Top Services by Spend**  
The **Month\-to\-Date Top Services by Spend** graph shows the services that you use most, along with the costs incurred for the month to date\. The **Month\-to\-Date Top Services by Spend** graph doesn't include forecasting\.

**Note**  
The Billing and Cost Management console has a refresh time of approximately 24 hours to reflect your billing data\.
