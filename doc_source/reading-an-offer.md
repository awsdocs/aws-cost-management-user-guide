# Reading an offer file<a name="reading-an-offer"></a>

An offer file lists the products and prices for a single AWS service in all Regions or a single AWS service in a specific Region\. Offer files are available as either CSV or JSON files\. You can read the files in multiple ways, such as using a spreadsheet program to read and sort the CSV file, a text program to read the file, or a program that parses JSON\.

Offer files include the following types of information:
+ [Offer file details](#offer-term-defs) – File metadata about the offer file itself, such as the format version and the publication date\.
+ [Product details](#offer-product-defs) – Product metadata that lists the products in an offer file along with product information\.
+ [Pricing details \(terms\)](#pricing-details) – Prices for all the products in this offer file\.

**Note**  
In a CSV file, the product and pricing details are combined into one section\. In a JSON file, the product details and pricing details are in separate sections\.

**Topics**
+ [CSV file](#csv)
+ [JSON file](#json)
+ [Offer file definitions](#pps-defs)

## CSV file<a name="csv"></a>

The first five rows of the CSV are the metadata for the offer file\. The sixth row has all the column names for the products and their attributes, such as the SKU, the `OfferTermCode`, the `RateCode`, the `TermType`, and more\. The number of columns varies depending on the service\. The first 12 columns contain all the pricing details, while the other columns contain the product details for a service\.

## JSON file<a name="json"></a>

In the JSON files, the product details and pricing details are in separate sections\. The same product can be offered under multiple terms, and the same term could apply to multiple products\. For example, an EC2 instance is available for an `Hourly` or `Reserved` term\. Use the SKU of a product to identify the terms that are available for that product\.

A JSON offer file looks like this:

```

   "formatVersion":"The version of the file format",
   "disclaimer":"The disclaimers for the offer file",
   "offerCode":"The code for the service",

                  }          
               }        
            }      
         }    
      }

## Offer file definitions<a name="pps-defs"></a>

Each of the sections in an offer file includes specific details about that product:
+ [Offer file details](#offer-term-defs) – File metadata about the offer file itself, such as the format version and the publication date\.
+ [Product details](#offer-product-defs) – Product metadata that lists the products in an offer file along with product information\.
+ [Pricing details \(terms\)](#pricing-details) – Prices for all the products in this offer file\.

**Note**  
In a CSV file, the product and pricing details are combined into one section\. In a JSON file, the product details and pricing details are in separate sections\.

The following lists provide definitions for each detail\.
