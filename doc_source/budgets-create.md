# Creating a budget<a name="budgets-create"></a>

You can create budgets to track and take action on your costs and usage\. You can also create budgets to track your aggregate Reserved Instance \(RI\) and Savings Plans utilization and coverage\. By default, single accounts, the management account, and member accounts in an AWS Organizations organization can create budgets\.
+ [Creating a cost budget](#create-cost-budget)
+ [Creating a usage budget](#create-usage-budget)
+ [Creating a reservation budget](#create-reservation-budget)
+ [Creating a Savings Plans budget](#create-savingsplans-budget)

When you create a budget, AWS Budgets provides a Cost Explorer graph to help you see your incurred costs and usage\. If you haven't used Cost Explorer, then this graph is blank and AWS Budgets enables Cost Explorer when you start to create your first budget\. You can create your budget without enabling Cost Explorer\. It can take up to 24 hours for this graph to appear after you or AWS Budgets enable Cost Explorer\.

**Note**  
After all of the **Budgeted Amounts** values in Planned Budget are used, the budget continues to use the last limit as the **Budgeted Amount**\. At that point, the planned budget provides the same experience as a fixed budget\. 

1. \(Optional\) For **Budget effective dates**, choose **Recurring Budget** for a budget that resets after the budget period or **Expiring Budget** for a one\-time budget that doesn't reset after the budget period\. The start and end effective dates depends on your selected period\.

1. Under **Configure alerts**, for **Alert 1**, choose **Actual** to create a notification for actual spend and **Forecast** to create a notification for your forecasted spend\.

   The **Forecast** option is not available for **Daily Budgets** because the daily budgeted amount is always evaluated against the day before\.

1. For **Alert threshold**, enter the amount that you want to be notified at\. This can be either an absolute value or a percentage\. For example, for a budget of 200 dollars, if you want to be notified at 160 dollars \(80% of your budget\), enter 160 for an absolute budget or 80 for a percentage budget\.

   Next to the amount, choose **Absolute amount** to be notified when the threshold amount is passed and **% of budgeted amount** to be notified when the threshold percentage of the budget is passed\.

   AWS verifies that your budget has permission to send notifications to your Amazon SNS topic by sending a test email to your Amazon SNS topic\. If the Amazon SNS topic ARN is valid but the **Verify** step fails, check the Amazon SNS topic policy to make sure that it allows your budget to publish to that topic\. 

   For a sample policy and instructions on granting your budget permissions, see [Creating an Amazon SNS topic for budget notifications](budgets-sns-policy.md)\. A notification can be subscribed to only one Amazon SNS topic\.

   To receive a notification, you must specify an email address\. You can also specify an Amazon SNS topic\.
