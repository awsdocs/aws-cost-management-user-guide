# Understanding your customer carbon footprint tool overview<a name="ccft-overview"></a>

Your customer carbon footprint tool page contains the following sections\. This page defines each console section, so you can understand the information provided in depth\.

The unit of measurement for carbon emissions is metric tons of carbon dioxide\-equivalent \(MTCO2e\), an industry\-standard measure\. This measurement considers multiple greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide\. All greenhouse gas emissions are converted to the amount of carbon dioxide that would result in equivalent warming\.

Carbon emissions data is available from January 2020 onwards\. New data is available monthly, with a delay of three months as AWS gathers and processes the data that's required to provide your carbon emissions estimates\. All values in the customer carbon footprint tool are rounded to the nearest one\-tenth ton\.

**Your carbon emissions summary**  
This section shows your estimated AWS emissions and estimated emissions savings, relative to an equivalent on\-premises workload\. This is summarized under two categories:  
+ Emission savings from AWS cloud infrastructure efficiencies
+ Emission savings from AWS purchase of renewable energy

**Your emissions by geography**  
This section shows the carbon emissions associated with each applicable geographical region\. This information shows high\-level geographical groupings such as AMER, EMEA, and not by AWS Regions\.

**Your emissions by service**  
This section shows the carbon emissions resulting from your usage of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(EC2\), Amazon Simple Storage Service \(S3\), and any other AWS products and services\.

**Your carbon emissions statistics**  
This section shows trends in your carbon emissions over time\. You can choose between a monthly, quarterly, or annual view\.

**Path to 100% renewable energy**  
This graph shows how your carbon emissions will change over time as AWS moves toward its goal of powering its operations with 100% renewable energy\. These figures are based on your current AWS usage profile\.  
The **Path to 100% renewable energy** graph isn't impacted by your **date range** selection\.
