# Managing your SEPA direct debit payment methods<a name="manage-debit-emea"></a>

If you meet the eligibility requirements, you can add an EU bank account as a SEPA direct debit payment method to your payment methods\. To meet these requirements, your account must:
+ Be an AWS Europe customer 
+ Have accepted SEPA terms and conditions
+ Have paid at least one invoice in full in the previous 12 months
+ Have paid at least $100 cumulative over the previous 12 months
+ Use euro as the preferred currency

If you pay by SEPA direct debit, AWS provides you with your invoice and initiates the charge to your payment method either the following day or the invoice due date, whichever is latest\. It can take up to 5 business days for the payment to complete successfully, even if the payment shows as **Succeeded** in the Billing and Cost Management console\.

You can use the [Payment Methods](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/paymentmethods) page of the Billing and Cost Management console to perform the following SEPA direct debit tasks:
+ [Add a direct debit account to your AWS Europe payment methods](#add-debit-emea)
+ [Update your linked debit account](#update-debit-emea)<a name="add-debit-emea"></a>
