Only personalized technical support requires a support plan\. For more information, visit [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/)\.

## Understanding your charged usage<a name="billing-support-usage"></a>

If you want to see the usage behind your charged amount, you can check your usage yourself by enabling Cost Explorer\. This tool enables you to analyze your costs in depth by providing you with premade reports and graphs\.

Cost Explorer is available 24 hours after you activate the feature\.

For more information about Cost Explorer, see [Analyzing your costs with AWS Cost Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/ce-what-is.html)\.

## Monitoring your Free Tier usage<a name="billing-support-Free"></a>

You can track your AWS Free Tier usage to keep you under the Free Tier limits\. You can set up alerts on your AWS account when your Free Tier limits reach a threshold, and monitor your usage through the Billing and Cost Management console\.

For more information about using these features, see [Tracking your AWS Free Tier usage](tracking-free-tier-usage.md)\.

To see details for usage that was charged beyond your Free Tier limit, see the [Understanding your charged usage](#billing-support-usage) section\.
