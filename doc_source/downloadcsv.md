# Downloading the CSV<a name="downloadcsv"></a>

When you want to review comprehensive detail, you can download a CSV file of the cost data that Cost Explorer uses to generate the chart, which is the same data that appears in the data table under the chart\. The data table sometimes does not display the complete data set used for the chart\. The CSV file contains the complete data set, including the current forecast numbers\. For more information, see [Reading the Cost Explorer Data Table](aboutdatatable.md)\.
