# Downloading the cost data CSV file<a name="ce-download-csv"></a>

When you want to review comprehensive detail, you can download a comma\-separated values \(CSV\) file of the cost data that Cost Explorer uses to generate the chart\. This is the same data that appears in the data table under the chart\. The data table sometimes doesn't display the complete dataset that is used for the chart\. For more information, see [Reading the Cost Explorer data table](ce-table.md)\. 

**To download a CSV file**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Cost Management at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cost\-management/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/home)\.

1. Configure Cost Explorer to use the options that you want to see in the CSV file\. 

1. Choose **Download CSV**\.

Note the following about the format of the CSV download:
+ If you view the CSV file in a table format, the fileâ€™s columns represent costs and the rows represent time\. When compared to the Cost Explorer data table in the console, the columns and rows are transposed\.
+ The file shows data with up to 15 decimal places of precision\.
+ The file shows dates in the YYYY\-MM\-DD format\.
