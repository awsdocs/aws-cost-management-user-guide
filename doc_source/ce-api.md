# Using the AWS Cost Explorer API<a name="ce-api"></a>

The Cost Explorer API allows you to programmatically query your cost and usage data\. You can query for aggregated data such as total monthly costs or total daily usage\. You can also query for granular data, such as the number of daily write operations for DynamoDB database tables in your production environment\. 

If you use a programming language that AWS provides an SDK for, we recommend that you use the SDK\. All the AWS SDKs greatly simplify the process of signing requests and save you a significant amount of time when compared with using the AWS Cost Explorer API\. In addition, the SDKs integrate easily with your development environment and provide easy access to related commands\.

For more information about available SDKs, see [Tools for Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/tools)\. For more information about the AWS Cost Explorer API, see the [AWS Billing and Cost Management API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/)\.
